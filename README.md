# Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma

Final project for the Laboratory of Computational Physics (Module A) course. In particular, the project is centered around the Prisoner's Dilema, a popular model in game theory. We developed the framework to both simulate and analyze different scenarios of this problem.

## Project structure
- Introduction and assignments

- Implementation and analysis:
    - Iterative Prisoner's Dilema (IPD)
    - Multiple Players IPD (MPIPD)
    - Repeated MPIPD with natural selection
    - Repeated MPIPD with natural selection and mutations
